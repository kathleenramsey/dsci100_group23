Some of this data (such as player personal information) would have been self-reported, and some (such as playing time) would have been observed. If responses from people playing on the server was voluntary, there could be a form of response bias present in the data or incorrectly reported data. \n",

Therefore we will end up training 5 different models: one with all genders included, and four filtered for particular levels."

    "**Proposed Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will investigate the skill of a KNN classifier using all available playing time data points from all experience levels. We will train, validate, and test this model using our standard procedures from worksheets and tutorials. If we are able to establish a classifier with some skill at predicting subscription class from playing times, we will then split the data by gender and retrain a classifier (using the k value for nearest neighbours found earlier) on each of these subclasses individually to investigate the difference in model skill and classification thresholds between male and gender-diverse players.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is appropriate because it relies on the standard training/validating/testing workflow to perform a classification task using one predictor and one output class which is well established in this course and in data science in general. We will have to assume that data is not biased or incorrectly reported to make valid claims about the results we find. The nature of the self-reported data for gender could be an issue-- we notice from figures that some players reported unreasonable ages (older than 150) and so it is not unlikely that some players would have also lied about their gender identity. The relatively low data volumes are also potentially a cause for concern. We will compare and select the model using a cross-validation process with 4 folds. To avoid running into lower data volume issues that could arise when trying to do a cross validation step after filtering between males and gender diverse people, we will use the optimized model parameters chosen using initial model selection with the full dataset in further steps."
