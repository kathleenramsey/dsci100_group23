    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frank Wood is leading a research group in computer science at UBC and collecting data about the ways people play video games by hosting a MineCraft server that automatically tracks player analytics. The group needs to strategically target recruitment efforts for players and ensure that their computational resources are sufficient to support their player base. They've accumulated the `players` dataset which we will work with to draw findings about player activity based on demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types? (Question 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extent can a player's played hours and age predict subscription status in the players dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will use the `players` dataset to create a KNN classifier that predicts subscription status. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `players` dataset includes 196 observations and 7 variables describing player demographic information and activity on the server. The following variables are included in the full dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Type | Description |\n",
    "|--------|----|-----------|\n",
    "| `experience` | character | Player's skill level |\n",
    "| `subscribe` | logical | Indicates whether player subscribes to a game-related newsletter |\n",
    "| `hashedEmail` |character | Unique identifier for each player (hashed) |\n",
    "| `played_hours` | numeric | Total accumulated play time on the server in hours |\n",
    "| `name` | character | Player's name |\n",
    "| `gender` | character | Gender |\n",
    "| `Age` | numeric | Player's age |\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our question, we are only interested in `subscribe`, `played hours`, and `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response variable:**\n",
    "* `subscribe`: Indicates whether a player is subscribed to a game-related newsletter, each value can be interpreted as one of two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanatory variables:**\n",
    "* `played hours`: The total number of hours a player has logged on the server. This is reliable as it is automatically tracked.\n",
    "* `age`: The self-reported age in years of a player. There could be response bias or incorrect information in this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age has two NA values. We will handle this by dropping those observations."

    "## Methods and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be training a KNN classifier off our player data in order to see if we can predict subscription status based on a player's played hours and age. We'll split our data, optimize our model, and assess its effectiveness.\n",

    "#### Step 1: Loading Libaries and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first load some libraries that we'll (absolutely or possibly) need. Then we'll read in our players dataset using a URL so that this project is able to run on different devices."
