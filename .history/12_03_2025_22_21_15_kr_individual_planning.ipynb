    "This dataset has 196 observations and 7 variables. There is one NA value in the dataset. There are many players with a played_hours value of 0, which could be an issue for some analysis. Some of this data (such as player personal information) would have been self-reported, and some (such as playing time) would have been observed. If responses from people playing on the server was voluntary, there could be a form of response bias present in the data \n",

    "3. **hashedEmail** (categorical, chr): a unique hashcode for each player representing a their email. This variable identifies unique players, since the first name of all players will likely not be unique.\n",
    "4. **played_hours** (quantative, dbl): how many cumulative hours of playtime does a player have?\n",
    "5. **name** (categorical, chr): a player's first name\n",
    "6. **gender** (categorical, chr): a player's gender identity\n",

    "The `players.csv` dataset has the variables `played_hours` and `subscribe`. `played_hours` will be used as the predictive variable for the binary classification `subscribe` in a standard knn classification scheme. Then, to explore the impacts of experience on the predictive ability of `played hours`, we will filter for each of the four experience levels in `experience` and retrain the model to explore changes in skill and the classification patterns that form. Therefore we will end up training 5 different models: one with all experience levels included, and four filtered for particular levels."
