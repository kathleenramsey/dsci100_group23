    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frank Wood is leading a research group in computer science at UBC and collecting data about the ways people play video games by hosting a MineCraft server that automatically tracks player analytics. The group needs to strategically target recruitment efforts for players and ensure that their computational resources are sufficient to support their player base. They've accumulated the `players` dataset which we will work with to draw findings about player activity based on demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types? (Question 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extent can a player's played hours and age predict subscription status in the players dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will use the `players` dataset to create a KNN classifier that predicts subscription status. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `players` dataset includes 196 observations and 7 variables describing player demographic information and activity on the server. The following variables are included in the full dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Type | Description |\n",
    "|--------|----|-----------|\n",
    "| `experience` | character | Player's skill level |\n",
    "| `subscribe` | logical | Indicates whether player subscribes to a game-related newsletter |\n",
    "| `hashedEmail` |character | Unique identifier for each player (hashed) |\n",
    "| `played_hours` | numeric | Total accumulated play time on the server in hours |\n",
    "| `name` | character | Player's name |\n",
    "| `gender` | character | Gender |\n",
    "| `Age` | numeric | Player's age |\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our question, we are only interested in `subscribe`, `played hours`, and `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response variable:**\n",
    "* `subscribe`: Indicates whether a player is subscribed to a game-related newsletter, each value can be interpreted as one of two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanatory variables:**\n",
    "* `played hours`: The total number of hours a player has logged on the server. This is reliable as it is automatically tracked.\n",
    "* `age`: The self-reported age in years of a player. There could be response bias or incorrect information in this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age has two NA values. We will handle this by dropping those observations."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Findings:\n",
    "The KNN models trained on different groups of players showed that total played hours is an important factor in predicting whether a player subscribes to a game-related newsletter. Players who spend more time playing the game are more likely to subscribe to the newsletter. This trend was observed in both male and gender-diverse players, though the model's performance varied across these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For all players (combined):** The model had an accuracy of 61.7%. This suggests that total played hours can provide a moderate prediction of subscription likelihood across the full player base.\n",
    "- **For male players:** The accuracy was 75%, indicating that played hours are an important predictor, but the model's performance is more reliable for male players than for the full dataset.\n",
    "- **For gender-diverse players:** The accuracy was 77%, suggesting that played hours are a particularly strong predictor for this group. Gender-diverse players might have a clearer connection between their in-game time and subscription behavior compared to male players.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this what you expected to find?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Outcomes**: We thought that total played hours would be an important factor for predicting newsletter subscriptions because players who play more may want to get more information, like newsletters. This fits with our expectations, as time spent in the game likely shows an interest in staying informed about game updates, events, and other content.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Unexpected Outcomes**: The difference in model performance between male and gender-diverse players was surprising. We thought played hours would be useful for both groups, but the model did better for gender-diverse players. This means that their behavior in the game might match their subscription choices more clearly. It also shows that gender might affect not just the chance of subscribing but also how players react to game marketing. This could depend on their interests, gaming habits, or how much they engage with the game community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower accuracy for male players suggests that there are other factors—possibly not in this dataset—that influence their decision to subscribe to newsletters. It may also mean that male players’ subscription behavior is less linked to in-game hours, or that including other features (like experience or age) would improve the model for this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the analysis showed that played hours is an important predictor for newsletter subscriptions, but it works better for gender-diverse players. This means that while played hours are helpful, exploring more features and improving the model (especially for male players) could make predictions more accurate for all players. Gender differences in how played hours predict subscription behavior could also be interesting to study further, as they may help us understand player behavior and improve marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What impact could such findings have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings and results emphasize how crucial it is to take gender diversity into consideration when developing predictive models for user behavior analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Targeted Marketing Strategies:** Since we have shown that subscription behaviour is more predictable for gender-diverse and male players, companies can use this insight to create effective advertisements aimed at these players without over-targeting or overlooking certain groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaming Product Design:** Game developers can explore why gender-diverse and male users like their game and newsletter and then use those discoveries to create more inclusive, engaging game features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encourages Inclusive Data Science Methods:** Our research highlights the importance of including a wide range of demographics groups when collecting data in order to gain a more complete picture of user behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discovering Hidden Model Biases:** The discrepancy between our overall accuracy (61.7%), male-only accuracy (75%), and gender-diverse accuracy (77%) demonstrates that certain subgroups may underperform or excel with specific models. This shows that data analysis should always involve subgroup analysis when evaluating accuracy of a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What future questions could this lead to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings and results open the door to a variety of thought-provoking questions that require further analysis to answer such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is the subscription predictive accuracy so low for the complete dataset? If we used models for each subgroup of gender, would all of them produce greater accuracies?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What reasons do different genders value the game and newsletter for? Is it the actual content of the game? Are certain genders more likely to develop an emotional connection? For instance, some players may feel a stronger emotional attachment because of the inclusivity and representation in the game and the community. Are certain genders more likely to rely on the newsletter or external sources for updates on the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How might other factors and their interactions with gender affect subscription predictability? For example, what would change if we also used experience or age as predictors?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How would our results change in larger datasets or different types of games?\n"
